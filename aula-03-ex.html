        <h1>The Largest Vocabulary<br>In Hip Hop</h1>
    
        <h2>Rappers, ranked by the number of unique words used in their lyrics</h2>

        <p class="details">with 75 new rappers including Brockhampton, Death <br>Grips, Lil Uzi Vert, Travis Scott, and Migos</p>
    
        <p>This project was originally published in 2014 and recently updated in <strong>January 2019</strong> with newer lyrics data and 75 additional artists, including Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, Migos, and 21 Savage.</p>

        <p>It compares the number of unique words used by some of the most famous artists in hip hop (that is, an example of a quantitive view of lyricism, once proposed by <a href="https://tahirhemphill.com/">Tahir Hemphill</a>). I used each artist’s first 35,000 lyrics. This way, prolific artists, such as Jay-Z, can be compared to newer artists, such as Drake.</p>

        <p>35,000 words covers 3 to 5 studio albums and EPs. I included mixtapes if the artist was short of the 35,000 words. Quite a few rappers don’t have enough official material to be included (for example, Biggie, Chance the Rapper, Queen Latifah, and El-P).</p>

        <p>Since the original release, there’s now a notable trend of fewer unique words among newer artists. This is easier to see in the following chart, where I highlighted each artist’s primary decade, based on album release dates for their vocabulary calculation (the first 35,000 lyrics).</p>
